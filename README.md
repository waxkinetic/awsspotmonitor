AwsSpotMonitor
==============

A very simple class for:

1. Monitoring how many EC2 spot-instances exist
2. Submitting new spot-instance requests when an instance is lost
3. Emailing a log of actions to specified recipients

This code comes from experimentation with using and managing AWS spot-instances instead
of on-demand or reserved instances.
